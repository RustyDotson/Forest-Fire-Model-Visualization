# For now, please clone the cmake branch if you would like to try out this program on your computer.

# Forest Fire Model Visualization
A visualization of the [self-organized criticality forest fire model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest-fire_model) using SFML graphics in C++

The project was originally built using MacOS with a custom MakeFile, so getting the original code to work on Windows or Linux would be difficult.

The cmake branch will be merged over to the main branch after it is confirmed the cmake version works on different systems.
