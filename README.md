# Forest Fire Model Visualization
A visualization of the [self-organized criticality forest fire model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest-fire_model) using SFML graphics in C++


The project was built using MacOS, so getting the code to work on Windows or Linux may be difficult. The Makefile in this project was designed for a Mac, so changes will need to be made depending on what os you are using. Windows will not be able to run make files by default. Please look into GNUWin32 or other packages in order to run on Windows. SFML's website: https://www.sfml-dev.org/. I will work on a cmake version of this to make it easier to run.

after getting the MakeFile setup correctly with your os building is as simple as:

 make

 ./main
