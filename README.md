The project was originally built using MacOS with a custom MakeFile, so getting the original code to work on Windows or Linux may be difficult. The Makefile in this project was designed for a Mac, so changes will need to be made depending on what os you are using. Windows will not be able to run make files by default. Please look into GNUWin32 or other packages in order to run on Windows.

cmake branch will be merged over to the main branch after it is confirmed the cmake version works on different systems.
