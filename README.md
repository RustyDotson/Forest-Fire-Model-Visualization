Make is not available by default on Windows. If you feel the need to use Windows, you can use cmake to help build, but you will need to write the cmakelists file yourself to get this working.

For Linux or Mac users, you have it a bit easier. All you need to do is setup the build generator through the makefile and then run. Be sure to have SFML installed on your computer in the location designated in the makefile. It's a bit tricky to setup, but you can learn more about how to do this on SFML's website: https://www.sfml-dev.org/.

building is as simple as:

 make

 ./main
